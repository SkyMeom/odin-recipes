Hi, girlfailure here.
I've decided to follow The Odin Project's series of development as a way to get myself familiar with github alongside having a sense of "I know what im doing!".

This is the recipe project, where you are tasked with making a website using HTML that contains recipes of the programmer's choosing. My version has 3 recipes:
Cookies
Soda Bread
Cupcake

Because I am lazy, there is no such recipe listed for either of them, but images are provided.
